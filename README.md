# **Airport Organizer**

## Abstract:
The **Airport Organizer**  is a digital system that implements a solution to handle flights reservations and the clients check-ins at their airline companies so they catch their flight.
The main focus are the flight reservations by an user and administration services that check-in a passenger and change the state of a flight in the boards.
To address all these questions, the platform must include three main services. The first one is a personal portal in which users can reserve a flight, check their reservations and search for different flights with different prices. 
The second service should be developed for the administration staff and staff that verifies the passengers and their luggage. This one needs to handle the registration of flight passengers, their luggage and their check-in. Staff can access waiting lines, access delayed or canceled flights and call for passengers to check luggage or to board a flight. 
The last service is a simple digital signage solution to handle the call screens at the airport. The calls will translate the boarding calls for the flights.
